Some output of my short academic career


# 2011 - Master thesis
In 2011 I wrote my Master Thesis as a member of the <a href="http://www.stratosphere.eu" target="_blank">Stratosphere-Project</a> in the institute <a href="http://www.dbis.informatik.hu-berlin.de/" target="_blank">Databases and Information Systems</a>. Within the Stratosphere Project PACT-programs were used to process large amounts of data in parallel on a distributed cluster computer architecture. However creating a PACT-program was very time-consuming, complicated, and required the installation of a development environment. My master thesis describes the implementation of the <a href="https://code.google.com/webtoolkit/" target="_blank">Google Web Toolkit</a> based PACT-GUI web application. The application allows to graphically model and implement PACT-programs within a rich client browser application. In future, the ease with which users can now generate PACT-programs may promote the wide adoption of Stratosphere System.

# 2010 - Latency in TOR
In 2010 I was part of a research team, that investigated to what extent users will accept decreases in usability for an increase of their anonymity. My contribution to the project was quantitative specifics about the latency due to <a href="https://www.torproject.org" title="The Onion Router Project - Homepage" target="_blank">TOR</a> usage.</p>

# 2006 - Bachelor thesis
From 2003 to 2006 I studied Business Information Systems at <a href="http://www.hwr-berlin.de/en/" target="_blank">The Berlin School of Economics and Law</a>. My final thesis was about the probably hotest topic in Tech at this time: <i>Mobile Web Browsing</i> :)
